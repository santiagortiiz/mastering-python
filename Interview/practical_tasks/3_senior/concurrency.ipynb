    "Write a Python script that fetches data from the following fake API https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/<post_id> for post_ids ranging from 1 to 100. The script should:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fetch data concurrently using Python’s concurrency mechanisms (using either concurrent.futures, asyncio, or multiprocessing).\n",
    "- Write the post title for each fetched response into a file called posts.txt.\n",
    "- Ensure that the file writes happen in the same order as the post_ids (even if the requests are handled concurrently).\n",
    "- Handle potential exceptions or network issues gracefully, such as timeouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "- You may choose your preferred concurrent programming tool (**concurrent.futures, asyncio, or multiprocessing**). The test will assess both feasibility (ideally solved in 10–15 minutes) and alignment with idiomatic Python.\n",
    "- Ensure the solution is efficient and maintains the correct order of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "- post_ids from 1 to 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "- A file named posts.txt, where each line contains a fetched post’s title. The order of lines should match the order of the post_ids."
